# ui2ai

This code creates desktop screen shots and trains the CNN with the screenshot data by having the user select a region on the screen shot that locates the relevant pixel array as coordinates for the Location of the Start Menu


update: so this is doing coordinate prediction, not image array analysis. Working this change to complete proof of concept. Will be looking into using Multi modal LLM's to attempt to workaround this need if it doesn't meet the criterea.
